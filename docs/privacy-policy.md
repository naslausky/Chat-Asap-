## Eduardo Naslausky: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Privacy Policy for my Android apps!

As I currently write this, there are two Android apps published under my name: [Tile Paths](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naslausky.tile_paths&hl=pt_BR&gl=US) and [Chat ASAP!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naslausky.chat_asap&hl=pt_BR&gl=US)

They are both open source Android apps developed by me (Eduardo Naslausky). 
The source code is available on GitHub; 
They are also available on Google Play.

Both of the apps don't collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data and preferences that the user creates are stored *only* on your device. 
You can clean all of that by simply unninstalling the app or cleaning the app data under the Android settings.
If you have any objections or questions, just let me know through my e-mail supplied at the app page.

My regards,  
Eduardo Naslausky.
